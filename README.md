# status-route

This library handles the status route reporting and aggregation, specifically 
tailored towards more complex service dependency hierarchies you frequently see
in microservices. 

It is specifically designed to not only allow the reporting of a single server's
status, but to also include all its dependencies (and their dependencies) in a
single report, resulting in an aggregated overview of an entire cluster's health.
